# Computer-Vision-for-Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Welcome to the Computer Vision for Hand Gesture Recognition project! This project aims to utilize computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures. Whether you're interested in learning hand gesture language, communicating with deaf-mute individuals, or exploring gesture-based communication in various contexts, this project provides a platform for recognition and understanding.

## Goals

- **Accurate Gesture Recognition**: Development of robust algorithms for accurate hand gesture recognition in different environments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive interface that allows users to easily receive descriptions of the recognized hand gestures.
- **Educational Resource**: Serves as a supportive resource for learning and practicing sign language.
- **Accessibility**: Facilitating communication between gesture users and those unfamiliar with sign language.

## Target Groups

- **Individuals Learning Hand Gesture Language**
- **People Communicating with Deaf-Mute Individuals**
- **Military Personnel**
